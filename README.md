# Process_mining

## Context and main goals 🔍
Aim of this notebook is to show how powerful process mining techniques are in identifying business process issues and providing the right insights to address them properly. In greater detail, I applied various techniques and algorithms available in Python PM4PY library to a dataset of process logs.  

## Data 💻
Data were provided by Kaggle and free for use: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asjad99/it-incident-management-process.

## Results 🎯
Using PM4PY I was able to identify business process issues (such as bottlenecks, people working less than other department colleagues,...) providing great insight for making the process far more efficient. I truly believe process mining will be used more and more in the near future.
